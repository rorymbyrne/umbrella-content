---
### A security plan only works if everyone follows it.

Different personalities may benefit from different approaches to make the plan security plan stick.    

## Understand why 

* Understanding the plan and why you made it will often help you follow through. Security planning doesn't just benefit you, it benefits your whole team, your families, and any victims, sources, witnesses, beneficiaries, supporters, funders, and community members that you work with.  
* Collect and share examples of what could go wrong if security is lax. 
* The security plan should not be just more work, but more effective work. How does the plan make your work more efficient, professional, reliable, robust, and resilient?   
 
## Consult 

* All team members should take part when you design or improve the plan. Include members of your family in discussions about security at home.  
* Sign a group agreement to follow the plan. Display it publicly and refer to it frequently. 
* Everyone must be seen to follow the plan, especially managers and team leaders.
* Ask how the plan is going. Is is appropriate and effective? What would make it better?   

*Security is not an individual choice, and it's not dictated by experts. Everyone should feel ownership over the process and responsibility for making it better.*

## Create Accountability

* How does your team show that they value security? How can you thank or reward someone for following the steps in the plan?  
* How does your team tell you if you fall short or miss a step? What is the consequence or sanction, and does everyone understand them? 
* What training or qualifications would help you incorporate security planning into your personal and professional development?  

## Pay attention

* When will you formally review how the plan is being followed? (Before or after an event? During a recurring meeting?) 
* When will you informally ask people how they feel about the plan and how they would improve it? 
* What format will let people share their experiences honestly, even if they fell short, feel responsible for a security breach, or hate something about the plan?  

## Diagnose problems

* Do you understand the plan?
* Do you understand how to apply it? 
* Is something in the plan complicated or confusing? Can you simplify?
* Is the plan hard to find when you need it? 
* Does the plan conflict with other needs or interests?
* Do you disagree with something in the plan or consider it unnecessary?
* Do you ignore the plan because you see other people ignoring it? 
* Do you need more time, money, or help to follow the plan?
* Does the plan interfere with something else you rely on for work? 
* Do health, stress, or relationship issues make it hard to follow the plan?
