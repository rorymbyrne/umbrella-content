### Assess your risk to determine your security priorities. 

Risk is the probability that you will suffer from harm or loss. Risk varies depending on the threat, but also how vulnerable you are, and what your capacities are.

To control risk:

* Identify threats;
* Reduce vulnerabilities; 
* Increase capacities.

Successfully controlling risk will bring it to an acceptable level. 

## Acceptable risk

We are all at constant risk of harm or loss from threatening events. But many risks are acceptable.

Many people accept risk if: 

* The probability of a threatening event is low (being struck by a meteorite from space);
* The impact is low (getting a paper cut); 
* The benefits outweigh the costs (driving even though you may be in an accident);
* There are manageable, affordable ways to control and reduce risk (taking advanced driving classes, or wearing a seatbelt). 

To manage security, you have to understand what level of risk you can accept, and whether the measures available to you to control your risk will bring it to an acceptable level or not. This is called risk assessment. 

## Risk assessment

A risk assessment is subjective, and it's just a tool. But it gives you a starting point for making security decisions. 

* Consider each threat you listed in your threat analysis in light of your vulnerabilities and capacities. What is the probability of the threat occurring? 

Rank the probability very high, high, medium, low, or very low. 

*For example, if the threat is having your work laptop stolen from your ground floor flat in a neighbourhood with high street crime, the probability of it happening might be high. But if you have a large, fierce dog that is wary of strangers, the probability might be lower.*     

* What will be the impact if it happens?

Rank the impact very high, high, medium, low, or very low. 

*For example, if your laptop holds unprotected personal information about sources that might help an adversary identify and harm them, the impact of the laptop being stolen could be very high. If that information is securely stored elsewhere, the impact would be lower.*    

* Use this assessment to create policies for your security plan.


  * What level of risk is not acceptable? (Exposure to high probabiliy, high impact threats? What else?) What rules will you follow to avoid this exposure?  
  
  * What changes can you make to control risk? Which changes have the highest priority?  
  
  * Who decides when exposure to threats is still necessary, despite the risk? How will they decide, and who will they tell?   

You may choose to limit all activities that come with a high probability of serious physical harm. You can also use the assessment to allocate resources to your highest security priority.
