### Make and follow a security plan based upon your own context and risk. 

Advice is rarely applicable to everyone. Different people may require different strategies depending on the time and place. The challenge is to identify the things in your environment that may result in harm or loss at any given moment. 

Follow these following steps to manage your security. 

## 1. Understand threats and vulnerabilities in your specific context

The kind of people (stakeholders) and events that may cause harm or loss (threats) depend on where you are (your context). Some things about you or your context may make you more vulnerable to certain threats.   

## 2. Assess your risk

How likely are the threats you have described to actually happen? How bad would the impact be?  

## 3. Write a security plan

Control risk by writing a security plan.  

For every threat, describe several measures you can take to: 

1. Mitigate risk (reduce the liklihood that the threat will happen); and,

2. Respond (reduce the impact if the threat does happen).  

## 4. Implement and review 

Make sure everyone on your team understands the security plan and when to act on it. Review your plans at least twice a year, more often if something changes.
